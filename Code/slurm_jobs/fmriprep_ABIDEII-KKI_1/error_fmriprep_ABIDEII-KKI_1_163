You are using fMRIPrep-20.2.0, and a newer version of fMRIPrep is available: 20.2.4.
Please check out our documentation about how and when to upgrade:
https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#upgrading
WARNING: Version 20.2.0 of fMRIPrep (current) has been FLAGGED

That means some severe flaw was found in it and we strongly
discourage its usage.
